Library to free X.Org window geometry shackles by turning off and locks
the `PResizeInc` flag when getting the WM_NORMAL_HINTS window property.

RATIONALE
---------

To free all window sizes while in tile mode, especially for terminal emulator
in stacking WM with third party programs (zentile, etc). So, the size becomes
flexible without being strict to geometry. Specifically used with LD_PRELOAD.

```
$ LD_PRELOAD='/usr/local/lib/xfog.so' program
```

The $LD_PRELOAD environment variable must at least be set when executing the
executable of window manager. For example, before `exec` in openbox-session.
